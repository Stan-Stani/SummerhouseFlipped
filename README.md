[Steam Discussion Thread](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2533960/discussions/0/4520010433851923604/)

## Todo


- [ ] In very early stages, so no download yet, but I'll get one up soon.
- [ ] Build instructions for devs


## Implemented
- Increase minimum and maximum depth of block placement
- Flip objects vertically
    - [X] Save and load vertically flipped blocks!
    - [ ] Bug: Sometimes doesn't load blocks vertically flipped

## Ideas

- More inhabitant sprites. Especially cats and other animals!!~!
- Auto weather & day night cycle.
- Lights on when it rains
- greater freedom of depth placement
- Increased camera movement bounds (horizontal and vertical)
- Way to add models/blocks
    - This would be difficult, me thinks.
- Don't pause on defocus https://steamcommunity.com/app/2533960/discussions/0/4418676821641523810/
- Vertical flip
