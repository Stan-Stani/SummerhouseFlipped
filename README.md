## Ideas

- More inhabitant sprites. Especially cats and other animals!!~!
- Auto weather & day night cycle.
- Lights on when it rains
- greater freedom of depth placement
- Increased camera movement bounds (horizontal and vertical)
- Way to add models/blocks
    - This would be difficult, me thinks.
- Don't pause on defocus https://steamcommunity.com/app/2533960/discussions/0/4418676821641523810/
